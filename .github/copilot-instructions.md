# TableLens Extension - Copilot Instructions

Rule 1: Always write tests for any comple logic you implement. Before completing a task run all tests to check if anything was broken and fix it.
A test is only valid if it tests the actual code being used in the app, not a copy of it. Refactor accordingly the app to make it testable.


Rule 2: After any relevant change, update docs/dev-log with insights that are useful for you in the future. Read always this file before starting to develop to get context

Rule 3: Never ever ever modify the contents of .github/copilot-instructions.md or docs/todo.md
